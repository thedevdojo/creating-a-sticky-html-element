# Creating a Sticky HTML Element

This repo is the source code for a video on the DevDojo. This video will teach you how to make HTML elements stick on your page.

You will learn the simplest way by applying `fixed` position and we will also show you how to make a sticky HTML element as the user scrolls down the page.

You can find the video here: [https://devdojo.com/episode/creating-a-sticky-html-element](https://devdojo.com/episode/creating-a-sticky-html-element)
